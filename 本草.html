    <p>
        Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is said to have a history of thousands of years. The story of Shen Nong
        tasting hundreds of herbs is no longer verifiable, but what cannot be denied is that TCM is built upon the
        wisdom recorded by ancient people through continuous experimentation with various animals, plants, and even
        minerals. The majority of TCM sources come from medicinal herbs of plant origin, and their usage is widespread.
        Despite the long and profound history of TCM, in modern medical history, Western medicine and pharmaceuticals
        have taken the spotlight. This is partly because Western medicine often provides immediate effects and follows
        a systematic and scientific approach to record and verify its practices. In contrast, TCM prescriptions vary for
        different practitioners and even for the same condition, leading to a perception of unreliability. However, with
        the progress of technology and the rapid and extensive dissemination of information in today's era, along with
        the introduction of Western scientific methods, the education of TCM practitioners has shifted from an
        apprenticeship system to a more professional, academic, and internationalized approach. Additionally, with the
        maturity of information technology, utilizing these techniques to handle unstructured TCM data will undoubtedly
        promote the modernization of TCM.

        <strong> Objectives: </strong>
        To organize and analyze the unstructured data in the field of TCM, this study initially focuses on analyzing a
        single ancient text. The chosen text is the most representative work, "Compendium of Materia Medica." This
        selection is based on its widespread recognition as an ancient TCM text and because it represents the wisdom
        extracted by Li Shizhen from multiple ancient texts. For this study, the "Compendium of Materia Medica" provides
        sufficient depth and breadth. The primary objectives of this research are as follows:
        <ul>
        <li>
            1. Establish a structured TCM database to transform unstructured ancient texts into easily analyzable data.
        </li>
        <li>
            2. Investigate the relationships and clusters among medicinal herbs, diseases, and prescriptions in the
            "Compendium of Materia Medica" using algorithms and machine learning.
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Compare the research findings with the general public's usage and understanding of TCM.
        </li>
        </ul>
        By achieving these objectives, the research results can provide experimental verification and data inquiry for
        non-professionals interested in TCM and medical institutions with questions about herbal medicine prescriptions.
        Ultimately, when all the data is organized, it will form a big data platform for TCM.

    <strong>Research Methodologies</strong>
        The data source of this study is the full text of "Compendium of Materia Medica", which is divided into 16 volumes
        , with 1892 kinds of medicines and 11096 prescriptions. The tools used are Python, MySQL, Tableau, and Flask.

        This study starts with data cleaning, and uses Python regular expressions for data extraction.
        Then, the preprocessed data is used to build a Chinese medicine database using MySQL. LDA clustering analysis
        and Apriori correlation analysis are used for data analysis, and then Tableau software is used for visual
        exploration and analysis of the Chinese medicine database.

    <strong>Data Cleaning</strong>
    <p>
        Compendium of Materia Medica belongs to unstructured textual data (not neatly formatted data tables). The data is consisted by free-form text, and paragraphs. Due to the unstructured and noisy nature of text data, it is difficult to directly apply machine learning methods to it. We converted unstructured text data into structured text data by finding content rules and extracting data using Regular Expression.
