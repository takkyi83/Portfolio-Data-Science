    <p>
        When you want to buy a mobile phone, what criteria do you use to make your choice? Do you simply buy one you like, or do you go for the cheapest option? Maybe a combination of both? Our decisions are often influenced by multiple factors, considerations, short-term and long-term impacts, and the weights of those impacts. For relatively simple decisions, like buying a mobile phone with 5 to 6 considerations, we can manage quite well. However, when it comes to decisions like determining the location of an airport, there could be dozens or even more considerations with intricate relationships. Often, there are conflicting criteria between different considerations. In the face of such complex choices, we often need scientific methods to assist us. One such approach is Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM), which is introduced here.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Multi-criteria Decision Making?</h2>
    <p>
        Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) refers to the process of making optimal decisions when faced with multiple competing or conflicting criteria. In such situations, different criteria may have varying impacts on the decision outcome, and these criteria may have different priorities. MCDM aims to find an effective way to comprehensively consider these criteria and identify the best possible solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        MCDM can be applied in various domains and problems, such as business management, investment decisions, resource allocation, urban planning, and environmental protection. In these scenarios, decision-makers need to consider multiple relevant factors and objectives and make trade-offs among them.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are several methods to address Multi-criteria Decision Making problems, and a few of them are introduced here:

    <ul>1. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP): This method converts the multi-criteria problem into a hierarchical structure and evaluates the relative importance of different criteria through pairwise comparison matrices to find the optimal solution.</ul>

    <ul>2. Weighted Sum Method: This method assigns weights to the importance of each criterion, then calculates the weighted sum for each alternative, ultimately selecting the alternative with the highest weighted sum as the best decision.</ul>

    <ul>3. Analytic Network Process (ANP): ANP is an extension of AHP, used to address complex decision problems with cyclic dependencies and interactions among criteria. ANP builds a network model with a hierarchical structure to assess the relative importance between different criteria and sub-criteria, and then combines the weights and makes the final decision. This method is particularly useful when dealing with complex MCDM problems, especially when there are interdependencies between criteria.</ul>


    <ul>4. Simple Additive Weighting (SAW): This method represents the importance of each criterion as weights and multiplies the performance of each alternative on each criterion by its respective weight. The products are then summed to obtain a comprehensive score for each alternative, and the one with the highest score is considered the best choice.</ul>

    <ul>5. Use Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) for selection and apply "Max Standardisation" to normalize attribute values.</ul>

    <ul>6. Combination of "Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)" and "Geometric Mean Standardization".</ul>

    <ul>7. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)</ul>


    Here, we will implement several MCDM algorithms using R code.
    </p>
    <p>Multi-criteria Decision Making is a complex problem, and different problems may require different methods and techniques to solve. Choosing the appropriate MCDM method depends on the specific characteristics and requirements of the problem at hand.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)</h2>
    <p>
        The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a systematic method used for dealing with multi-criteria decision-making problems. It was proposed by American mathematician and operations researcher Thomas L. Saaty in 1970. The goal of AHP is to assist decision-makers in structuring, quantifying, and comparing different criteria and alternative solutions in complex decision situations, ultimately finding the optimal decision solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fundamental idea of AHP is to decompose the decision problem into multiple levels (Hierarchy), where each level represents a set of factors or criteria, and there are parent-child relationships between levels. The top-level is the goal level, representing the overall objective or problem. The next level is the criteria level, containing various criteria or factors needed to achieve the goal. The next level is the alternatives level, containing different alternative solutions. Within each level, there are pairwise comparisons among the elements.
    </p>

    <p>
        The advantages of AHP lie in its ability to structure complex decision problems, transform subjective evaluations into quantitative data, making the decision process more transparent and objective. It helps decision-makers gain a better understanding of the hierarchical structure of the decision problem and the relative importance among factors, leading to more informed decisions. Therefore, AHP finds widespread applications in various fields, including business management, engineering planning, environmental assessment, and others.
    </p>

    <ul>
        1. Creating the comparison matrix: First, create a 3x3 comparison matrix M to compare the relative importance among three elements. The comparison matrix is symmetric, with diagonal elements equal to 1, representing self-comparisons.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
    # Import the gdata library
    library(gdata);

    # Create a 3x3 diagonal matrix M
    M <- diag(3);

    # Assign values to M
    M[2,3]<-1/3;
    M[1,3]<-3;
    M[1,2]<-5;

    # Calculate the lower triangle of M from the upper triangle
    lowerTriangle(M) <- 1/upperTriangle(M, byrow=TRUE);
</code></pre>

    <ul>
        2. Normalizing the comparison matrix: Normalize each column of the comparison matrix M so that the sum of each column becomes 1, resulting in the normalized pairwise comparison matrix MP.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
    # Calculate the sum of each column of M and store it in the vector V
    V<-c(0,0,0);
    V<-colSums(M);

    # Divide each element of vector V by the corresponding column sum to get the normalized pairwise comparison matrix MP
    MP<-matrix(0,3,3);
    MP[,1]<-M[,1]/V[1];
    MP[,2]<-M[,2]/V[2];
    MP[,3]<-M[,3]/V[3];
</code></pre>

    <ul>
        3. Computing the relative priorities: Calculate the row averages of the normalized pairwise comparison matrix MP to obtain the relative priorities vector CWV.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
    # Calculate the row averages of MP to get the relative priorities vector CWV
    CWV<-c(0,0,0);
    CWV<-rowMeans(MP);
</code></pre>

    <ul>
        4. Using geometric mean: Calculate the geometric mean of each row in the normalized pairwise comparison matrix MP to obtain the new relative priorities vector CWV2.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
    # Calculate the CWV2 vector using the geometric mean method
    CWV2<-c(0,0,0);
    CWV2[1]<-(MP[1,1]*MP[1,2]*MP[1,3])^(1/3);
    CWV2[2]<-(MP[2,1]*MP[2,2]*MP[2,3])^(1/3);
    CWV2[3]<-(MP[3,1]*MP[3,2]*MP[3,3])^(1/3);
</code></pre>

    <ul>
        5. Consistency analysis: Check the consistency of the decision-maker's judgments regarding the comparison matrix through consistency testing. Consistency indices (CI) and consistency ratios (CR) are used. If the CR value is less than 0.1, it indicates acceptable consistency; otherwise, it suggests inconsistency.<br>
        If the consistency is acceptable, the decision process can proceed.<br>
        If the consistency is not acceptable, the decision-maker should reconsider and possibly revise the pairwise comparison judgments before conducting the analysis again.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
    # Calculate the vector V, which is the "weighted sum" by summing each row's values. '%*%' represents matrix multiplication.
    V <- M %*% CWV;

    # Divide the elements in the resulting "weighted sum" vector by the corresponding priority values.
    X<- V/CWV;

    # Calculate the average of the resulting values, denoted as Lambda_Max.
    Lambda_Max <- mean(X);

    # Calculate the consistency index (CI).
    CI <- (Lambda_Max-3)/(3-1);

    # Calculate the consistency ratio (CR).
    CR <- CI/0.58;

    # Determine whether the consistency test is accepted or not based on CR.
    if (CR > 0.1)
    {
      print("Failed consistency test");
    }
    else
    {
      print("Passed consistency test");
    }
</code></pre>


    <h2>2. Analytic Network Process (ANP)</h2>
    <p>
        ANP is a multi-criteria decision-making method used to address complex decision problems, particularly those with interdependencies among multiple criteria and sub-criteria.
    </p>

    ANP is an extension of AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and is used to tackle multi-criteria decision-making problems with cyclic dependencies and interactions.
    <p>
        Here, ANP is applied to evaluate Airport Accessibility. The evaluation involves four aspects: Market Attractiveness Rating (MAR), Airport Accessibility (ACC), Cost of Stay (COS), and Cultural Attractions Points (CAP).
    </p>

    <ul>
        1. Market Attractiveness Rating (MAR):
        This code calculates the score for market attractiveness. It creates a 7x7 diagonal matrix M and sets certain elements to represent the relative importance between different factors (pairwise comparisons). The matrix is then normalized to obtain the normalized pairwise comparison matrix MP. The row averages of MP are calculated to obtain the relative priority vector CWV.

        2. Airport Accessibility (ACC):
        Similar to the MAR part, this code calculates the score for airport accessibility. It involves creating a 7x7 diagonal matrix M, setting certain elements to represent pairwise comparisons, normalizing the matrix, and calculating the row averages to obtain the relative priority vector CWV1.

        This code calculates the score for the cost of stay. It creates a 7x7 diagonal matrix COS and sets certain elements to represent pairwise comparisons.

    <h2>3. Simple Additive Weighting (SAW)</h2>

    The SAW method allows decision-makers to allocate weights to attributes based on their relative importance. Then, it calculates the weighted sum of attribute values for each alternative, which helps in ranking the alternatives and aids in the decision-making process.

    <ul>
        1. Create an empty data frame "y" to store the attribute values for each car choice. The data frame has 4 rows representing car models ('Civic', 'Saturn', 'Ford', 'Mazda') and 3 columns representing attributes ('Style', 'Reliability', 'FuelEco').

        <pre><code class="language-r">
            # Create empty data frame
            y <- data.frame(matrix(data=0, ncol = 3, nrow = 4));
            colnames(y) <- c("Style","Reliability","FuelEco");
            rownames(y) <- c("Civic","Saturn","Ford","Mazda");
            str(y);
        </code></pre>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        2. Use the "c()" function to assign attribute values to each row of the car choices. Each row is filled with the attribute values (Style, Reliability, FuelEco) of the car model.

        <pre><code class="language-r">
            # Assign atrribute values to each alternative row
            y["Civic",] <- c(7,9,9);
            y["Saturn",] <- c(8,7,8);
            y["Ford",] <- c(9,6,8);
            y["Mazda",] <- c(6,7,8);
        </code></pre>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        3. Add an additional column "SAW_score_vector" to store the calculated SAW scores for each car choice. Initialize all scores to 0.

        <pre><code class="language-r">
            # Append a column to store the SAW-ed scores for each alternative
            SAW_score_vector <- c(0,0,0,0);
            y<-cbind(y,SAW_score_vector);
        </code></pre>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        4. Define "SAW_weight_vector" representing the weights assigned by the decision-maker (DM) to each attribute.

        <pre><code class="language-r">
        SAW_weight_vector <- c(0.3,0.4,0.3);
    </code></pre>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        5. Calculate the weighted total score for each car choice by multiplying the attribute values with the weight vector. Store the computed scores in the "SAW_score_vector" column for each car choice.

        <pre><code class="language-r">
        SAW_weight_vector * y["Civic",];
        y["Civic","SAW_score_vector"] <- sum (SAW_weight_vector * y["Civic",]);

        SAW_weight_vector * y["Saturn",];
        y["Saturn","SAW_score_vector"] <- sum (SAW_weight_vector * y["Saturn",]);

        SAW_weight_vector * y["Ford",];
        y["Ford","SAW_score_vector"] <- sum (SAW_weight_vector * y["Ford",]);

        SAW_weight_vector * y["Mazda",];
        y["Mazda","SAW_score_vector"] <- sum (SAW_weight_vector * y["Mazda",]);
    </code></pre>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        6. Rank the choices in descending order based on the calculated SAW scores. The ranking results are stored in the "SAW_rank_vector" column.

        <pre><code class="language-r">
        SAW_rank_vector <- order(-y$SAW_score_vector);
        y<-cbind(y,SAW_rank_vector);
        </code></pre>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Using Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) for Selection with Max Standardization</h2>

    The code for the SAW example is similar to the previous one. The difference lies in step 3, where we construct a new data frame "y_standardised" before calculating SAW scores. This new data frame is used to store the standardized attribute values. Each attribute value is divided by the maximum value of that attribute to perform max standardization. The remaining steps are the same.

    Max standardization allows us to transform values of different attributes into the same range, making their impact equal when calculating weights and aiding in more accurate decision-making.

    <pre><code class="language-r">
        # Construct standardized y
        y_standardised <- y;
        y_standardised[,"Style"]<-y[,"Style"]/max(y[,"Style"]);
        y_standardised[,"Reliability"]<-y[,"Reliability"]/max(y[,"Reliability"]);
        y_standardised[,"FuelEco"]<-y[,"FuelEco"]/max(y[,"FuelEco"]);
        y<-y_standardised;
    </code></pre>

    <h2>5. Using Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) with Geometric Mean Standardization</h2>

    In the SAW method, before step 3, we calculate "y_standardised" using geometric mean to standardize "y." The rest of the steps remain the same.

    <pre><code class="language-r">
        # Construct standardized y
        y_standardised <- y;
        y_standardised[,"Style"]<-y[,"Style"]/sqrt(sum(y[,"Style"]^2));
        y_standardised[,"Reliability"]<-y[,"Reliability"]/sqrt(sum(y[,"Reliability"]^2));
        y_standardised[,"FuelEco"]<-y[,"FuelEco"]/sqrt(sum(y[,"FuelEco"]^2));
        y<-y_standardised;
    </code></pre>

    In both cases, the standardized "y" allows for better comparison and equal weighting of attributes during the SAW process, leading to more accurate decision-making.


    <h2>6. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)</h2>

    TOPSIS is a multi-attribute decision-making method used to find the best choice among competing alternatives. The basic idea is to identify an ideal solution and an anti-ideal solution and then rank each alternative based on its similarity to these extreme solutions. It is applicable to various decision-making and ranking problems, allowing decision-makers to better understand and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each alternative and make better choices. It is important to note that the results of the TOPSIS method depend on the chosen standardization method and the weight vector, so careful consideration of these parameters is necessary during the decision-making process.

    <ul>
        1. Create a Decision Matrix: First, combine all attribute values of competing alternatives into a decision matrix, where each row represents an alternative, and each column represents an attribute.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
            DecisionMatrix<-matrix(0,4,4);
            DecisionMatrix[1,]<-c( 49, 81, 81, 64);
            DecisionMatrix[2,]<-c( 64, 49, 64, 49);
            DecisionMatrix[3,]<-c( 81, 36, 64, 81);
            DecisionMatrix[4,]<-c( 36, 49, 64, 36);
            DecisionMatrix;
        </code></pre>

    <ul>
        2. Standardize the Decision Matrix: Standardize the decision matrix to avoid unfair results due to the differences in value ranges of different attributes. Standardization methods can include max-min normalization, z-score normalization, etc. After standardization, each attribute's value will fall within the range of 0 to 1.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
            #Normalize the decision matrix according to the standard operation defined by TOPSIS
            NumRows<-nrow(DecisionMatrix);
            NumCols<-ncol(DecisionMatrix);
            D_normalize<-matrix(0,NumRows,NumCols);
            for ( j in c(1:NumCols) )
             {   D_normalize[,j]<-DecisionMatrix[,j]/sqrt(sum(DecisionMatrix[1:NumRows,j]^2))
             };

            #Setup the criterion weight vector CWV and compute the weighted (normalized) decision matrix WNDMatrix
            CWV<-c(.1,.4,.3,.2);
            WNDMatrix<-matrix(0,NumRows,NumCols);
            for ( j in c(1:NumCols))
             {   WNDMatrix[,j]<-CWV[j]*D_normalize[,j];
             };
        </code></pre>

    <ul>
        3. Identify the Ideal and Anti-Ideal Solutions: In the standardized decision matrix, find the ideal solution (A+) and anti-ideal solution (A-). The ideal solution is the maximum value for each attribute, while the anti-ideal solution is the minimum value for each attribute.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
            # Determine the ideal A_plus and anti-ideal solution A_minus
            A_plus<-c(0,0,0,0);
            for ( j in c(1:NumCols))
             {   A_plus[j]<-max(WNDMatrix[1:NumRows,j]);
             };
            A_plus;
            # Give a special process because 4 is TLTB
            A_plus[4]<-min(WNDMatrix[1:NumRows,4]);

            A_minus<-c(0,0,0,0);
            for ( j in c(1:NumCols))
             {   A_minus[j]<-min(WNDMatrix[1:NumRows,j]);
             };
            # Give a special process because 4 is TLTB
            A_minus[4]<-max(WNDMatrix[1:NumRows,4]);
        </code></pre>

    <ul>
        4. Calculate the Similarity to Ideal and Anti-Ideal Solutions: Compute the distance of each alternative from the ideal solution (referred to as S+) and the distance from the anti-ideal solution (referred to as S-). Usually, Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance is used to calculate similarity.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
        # Calculate the seperation measure for each alternative

        # Distances toward ideal solution A_plus
        S_to_ideal<-c(1:NumRows);
        for( i in c(1:NumRows) )
         {   S_to_ideal[i]<-sqrt( sum(
                                       (WNDMatrix[i,]-A_plus[])^2
                                     )
                                );
         };

        # Distances toward anti-ideal solution A_minus
        S_to_anti_ideal<-c(1:NumRows);
        for( i in c(1:NumRows) )
         {   S_to_anti_ideal[i]<-sqrt( sum(
                                           (WNDMatrix[i,]-A_minus[])^2
                                          )
                                     );
         };
        </code></pre>

    <ul>
        5. Calculate the Relative Closeness: Use S+ and S- to calculate the relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution, usually represented by Ti.
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-r">
            # Calculate the relative closeness (of each alternative) to the ideal solution, which is the Tie-Jin Xi-Shu
            RC<-c(1:NumRows);
            for( i in c(1:NumRows) )
             {   RC[i]<-S_to_anti_ideal[i]/(S_to_ideal[i]+S_to_anti_ideal[i]);
             }; # Equivalant to: RC<-S_to_anti_ideal/(S_to_ideal+S_to_anti_ideal)
        </code></pre>

    <ul>
        6. Rank

        the Decision Alternatives: Rank the alternatives based on their relative closeness (Ti) values. The higher the Ti value, the closer the alternative is to the ideal solution, and the higher it ranks.
    </ul>
    <pre><cpde>
            order(RC, decreasing=TRUE);
            RC[order(RC, decreasing=TRUE)];
        </cpde></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        In this MCDM analysis, we explored three prominent methods: SAW, Max Standardization, and Geo-Mean. Additionally, we examined TOPSIS.
    </p>
    <p>
        The SAW method allowed decision-makers to assign weights to attributes and rank alternatives based on weighted values. Max Standardization ensured a fair comparison of alternatives with different value ranges, while Geo-Mean provided a balanced evaluation.</p>
    <p>
        TOPSIS ranked alternatives based on their similarity to ideal and anti-ideal solutions, aiding decision-makers in understanding strengths and weaknesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each method's effectiveness depends on the decision context, attribute weights, and standardization. MCDM provides valuable tools for complex decision scenarios in various fields.
